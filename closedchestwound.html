Closed Chest Wound

        <h3>
Damaged ribs, or an abdominal injury
        </h3>
        
        <h4>
        SYMPTOMS    
        </h4>
        <p>
Victim will have trouble breathing. Cause will often be clear, as a major accident would be required to cause that much harm.
        </p>
        
        <h4>
        TREATMENT    
        </h4>
        <p>
Ensure the victim is comfortable. Check vitals, and watch for possible unconsciousness. Do not let the victim have food or drink. Encourage the victim to lay/lean on a table or surface, to take strain off of the body.
