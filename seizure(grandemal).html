        Seizure (Grande mal)

Rapid release of electrical power inside the brain

        <h4>
        SYMPTOMS    
        </h4>
        <p>
Victim go rigid/unconscious, and after a few seconds of delay, will enter the clonic phase. The clonic phase includes muscle spazzes, teeth grinding, and flicking/clenching of limbs. Try to clear the area of hard objects, and other people. Attempt to protect the victim's head during the seizure, but NEVER restrain the victim's movements.
        </p>
        
        <h4>
        TREATMENT    
        </h4>
        <p>
Attempt to track the number of times the victim seizes, and how long the seizure lasts. A victim may have a seizure, stop moving, then seize again. Be very careful, and wait until the victim regains full consciousness before pursuing treatment. Treat for shock, and any injuries the victim may have gained during the clonic phase.
