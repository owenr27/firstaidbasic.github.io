        Before administering the shock...    
        </h4>
        <p>
Make sure everyone is clear, and not touching the victim. Have everyone step away from the victim, as bystanders or yourself could be injured by the aed's shock. Do a splash check - Pat down victim and areas near them, if there is enough water to make any splash, do not administer shock. Dry the victim and the areas around them again, and do a splash check again.
