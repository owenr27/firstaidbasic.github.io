        Steps    
        </h4>
        <p>
1. Check vital signs, including breathing, pupils, level of consciousness (LOC), pulse, and skin. 2. Check levels of consciousness - When initially assessing level of consciousness during the primary stage, give a quick answer (yes/no). Further elaborate on that answer, whilst completing the secondary assessment. Types of concsiousness include conscious, where the victim is responsive, confused/disoriented, or dizzy (falling asleep). The victim can also be unconscious, but still can hear surroundings, feel pain, whilst being completely unresponsive. 3. Check breathing, are there any pains or sounds in the chest while breathing? What is the rate of breathing (BPM), is it normal rhythm? 4. Check pulse (on wrist, neck, or a babyâ€™s bicep). Make sure to look for beats/minute, speed, and strength of the pulse. 5. Check the pupils (Small black dot in eye), do they react to light, are they equally sized? 6. Check the skin for unusual temperature, moisture, and colour (or lack of).
