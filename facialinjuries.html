        SYMPTOMS    
        </h4>
        <p>
Victim's injury will likely be very obvious. Attempt to comfort the victim, as they will be in immense pain.

        <h4>
        TREATMENT    
        </h4>
        <p>
Clear airways, that could be covered by injury. If a spinal could have been possible, assume it did happen. Put victim into semi-prone, ensuring to watch the airways. Ir airway becomes blocked, use mouth-to-nose for breathing.
