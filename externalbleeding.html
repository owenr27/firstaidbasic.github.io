        SYMPTOMS    
        </h4>
        <p>
Many different types of injury. Abrasion: Scratched/scraped or lightly bloodied, be sure to remove any dirt or rocks that may be inside the cut. Contusion: Bruise, or other discolouration. Incision: Cuts, or slashes. Laceration: Torn open, will have the most bleeding of all. Evession: Flap of skin torn/peeled back. Puncture: Stab-like wound caused by a sharp or pointed object. Embedded object: A puncture where the object was left in the victim. Do not remove object. Amputation: Can be a complete amputation, where the limb is completely detached from the body. Or can be a partial amputation, where the limb is only partially detached from body.
        </p>
        
        <h4>
        TREATMENT    
        </h4>
        <p>
Wrap tightly with gauze. Never remove gauze after it has been applied. If there is an embedded object, wrap around it, keeping it anchored in the same position. Treat for shock.
