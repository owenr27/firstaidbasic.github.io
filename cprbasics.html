        CPR Steps    
        </h4>
        <p>
Open the airway, by tilting the victim's chin upwards. Seal the mask over mouth/nose, establishing a barrier device. Give one breath, and watch to see if the chest rises/falls. If first breath doesn’t work, reposition the head and airway. Give second breath. Always give 2 breaths, no more, no less. Begin cycles of 30 chest compressions. Repeat breaths and compression cycle until an aed arrives. When you receive the AED, put it on asap (pause CPR). Once the AED is on, follow the prompts, whilst continuing CPR.

        <p>
During hazard check, determine if it is a spinal injury. If victim is pulled from water, give breaths first. If victim vomits, roll them into semi prone, then scoop out the vomit. If victim has a swelling/bulging stomach, readjust, and give smaller breaths (possible gastric distention). When the victim begins to breathe, treat for shock, but don’t let them get up. If there are two rescuers, split up the work between the two, have one rescuer do breaths, and the other does compressions. Also one rescuer could perform CPR, while the other does a secondary assessment. If victim is pregnant, put a towel/soft item on right side of back (moves baby).
